Rewrite of [pxTwitter-Mosaic](https://github.com/dangeredwolf/pxTwitter-Mosaic) in Rust.
This has the same algorithm and functionality as the original project, but it's optimized.

This is still very experimental and needs to be tested before using in production.  
I'm also somewhat new to Rust, so some code can definitely be improved.
