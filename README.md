![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=rust)

Implementation of [mosaic-reference](https://github.com/FixTweet/mosaic-reference) in Rust originally written by [Antonio32A](https://github.com/Antonio32A) and grealy improved by [Deer-Spangle](https://github.com/Deer-Spangle).  
This has the same algorithm and functionality as the TypeScript reference project, but it's optimized.
